# PAE_Algorithms

# Algorithms.py
Implements: 
- check_availability(tracks)        #with 4 easy variables
- run_selected_list(selected_list)  #with 4 easy variables

Still missing: 
- Front-back comms
- Check of complex algorithm needs
- actual calculation of the complex algorithms

# shock_index.py
Computes the Shock Index
- The tracks are selected based on our equipment, for other implementation please do check your tracks so you can correctly select the desired parameter.
